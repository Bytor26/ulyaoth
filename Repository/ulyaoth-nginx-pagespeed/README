Please be aware this spec file is based on the original spec file that nginx provides in their source rpm packages.

You can build the rpms by running the build script:

ulyaoth-nginx-pagespeed:
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sbagmeijer/ulyaoth/master/Repository/ulyaoth-nginx/build-ulyaoth-nginx-pagespeed.sh ; chmod +x build-ulyaoth-nginx-pagespeed.sh ; ./build-ulyaoth-nginx-pagespeed.sh
