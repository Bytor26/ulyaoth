This contains all required materials to build the ulyaoth-nginx-passenger rpm.

Current versions:
Nginx Version: 1.6.0
Passenger Version: 4.0.45

How to Build:
Copy the folder "nginx" that you find in "etc" into your linux build server /etc so you have /etc/nginx/

copy the "rpmbuild" folder to a specific build user so for example if you use the user ulyaoth then copy it to his home
folder so you finally end up with "/home/ulyaoth/rpmbuild"

How to create a user/group:
useradd ulyaoth
usermod -a -G ulyaoth ulyaoth

Make ofcourse sure you have the rpmbuild tools installed!
For Fedora this is: 
yum install @development-tools
yum install fedora-packager

Once this is done then go into the rpmbuild/spec folder and run the following commands:
yum-builddep spotify-client.spec
rpmbuild -bb nginx.spec

You should now end up with a rpm that has passenger included, if you builded on the server you will install this you have to 
removed the /etc/nginx directory before installing it as this only contains the source code for passenger.

I got the original spec file from the Nginx official website and used their source rpm, I got passenger simpely from running "gem install passenger".
So i take no credit in developing those products I simpely created a up to date rpm for nginx and passenger by altering the spec file from nginx source rpm.
